Modern technology is an absolute wonder, but has it hindered our minds?

## The problems with today
In technical fields these days everything is buried behind many layers of abstration because technology has moved to a point where its possible, and this way its just easier to learn and apply. But has this affected the ability of our brains to truly understand whats happening? I would argue yes, for the simple reason it avoids learning from first principles. Learning how to use a tool is all well and good, but your proficiency will always be inferior to someone who truly understands how the tool works and what it *really* does, and even more so compared to someone who has gone through the effort to learn how the task is done without the tool at all. Why this is the case is quite obvious to me, the brain can build a pyramid of knowledge from the ground up, connecting concepts together more tightly and having a stronger mental model of the abstraction the tool presents. This inevitably leads to cleaner and more efficient solutions to problems. 

## Aside on Adrian Newey
To truly prove this point we need to look at a real world example, and what better than Formula 1 aerodynamic genius Adrian Newey. He's been in the business of making race cars go fast for over 40 years, and for much of that time he's been considered among the best, however these days he's lonely at the top. And while every other engineer uses advanced computer aided desgin and fluid simulations, he still architects the quickest cars in the world with nothing but pen and paper. So how on earth does he do it? Outperforming everyone while using inferior technology must be impossible, right? Well, not exactly. The truth is he just understands aerodynamics better than everyone else *because* his process forces him to, and has done for 40 years. You might counter by saying he's a once in a lifetime genius, and while he is undoubtedly a genius, back in the older eras of F1 where technology didn't dominate design he was far from unique. Steve Nichols and Gordon Murray designed the MP4/4, argubly the most dominant F1 car of all time, John Barnard, Patrick Head, go just a little bit before Neweys time you have Collin Chapman just to name a few. All geniuses. All understood their field from first principles, an art sadly lost today. 

## My own experience  
Over the past few months I've been interning at a large tech company, and during that time I thought a lot about my approach to problem solving and how to optimise it. The exact technolgies are not relevant, but I was dealing with a lot of systems/tools for the first time that were very astract and far away from what was happening on the machine itself. Eventually I came to the realisation that my brain made the most headway when problem solving when I did research into how the system works, rather than simply how to do a task. And whats more, this process of learning how things worked carried over into other problems, the knowlege was transferrable! Suddenly the big picture became clearer and clearer, with every hurdle melting away. The ultimate prize with learning from first principles is true understanding.

Technology can be a crutch that hinders your development, but you can use it to your advantage as long as you seek out how the abstractions truly work.
